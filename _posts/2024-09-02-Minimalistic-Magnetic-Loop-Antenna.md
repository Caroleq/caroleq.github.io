This article describes a magnetic loop antenna I built to listen to signals in high frequency range. I wanted to put minimum effort to have a device that enables reception of signals in high frequency range. Efficiency, accuracy and tunability were secondary issues. [This article](https://www.nonstopsystems.com/radio/frank_radio_antenna_magloop-2turn.htm) is an example description of antenna that was designed with paying much more attention to these features.  

Thank you to Joachim for helping me to build the antenna.
