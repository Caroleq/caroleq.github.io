This article describes a magnetic loop antenna I built to listen to signals in high frequency range. I wanted to put minimum effort to have a device that enables reception of signals in high frequency range. Efficiency, accuracy and tunability were secondary issues. [This article](https://www.nonstopsystems.com/radio/frank_radio_antenna_magloop-2turn.htm) is an example description of antenna that was designed with paying much more attention to these features. 
After building an antenna that receives high frequency signals I plan to build a DIY ham radio that could process these signals (for the moment I use HackRF One to receive signals from antenna). 

Prerequisites: To understand the article it would be beneficial to be familiar with operation of magnetic loop antenna, radio transmission, basic concepts of electronics and equipment used to measure antenna parameters and performance.

Caution: If you plan to use this post to build your own antenna, keep in mind that it is intended only for receiving signals. Construction of the antenna may not be suitable for signal transmission for a few reasons: 
1. While transmitting voltage on magnetic loop capacitor may reach a few kV. Electrical breakdown will probably occur on the capacitor used in this antenna after applying such a high voltage. 
2. If SWR of an antenna is too high, the output stage of transmitter may get broken. I did not analyze SWR of the built antenna in terms of risk of destroying transmitter.     

Acknowledgements: Thank you to Joachim for helping me to build the antenna.
