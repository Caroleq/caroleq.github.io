The post is the first post in a cycle concerning analysis of electronic circuit of Monacore Solid State Stereo SA-800 Amplifer. It was an audio amplifier produced in the 70s [1]. Official amplifier documentation not available at the manufacturer website. The main source of information about the amplifier was www.radiomuseum.org, which has the amplifier documentation (including electronic circuit). It is available at https://www.radiomuseum.org/r/monacor_solid_state_stereo_ampli.html.   

As mentioned before the cycle concerns the electronic circuit of the amplifier. This post describes available inputs and outputs of the device and gives a high-level overview on the main circuit components. In subsequent I will discuss these components in detail. I plan to redraw the circuit parts from image into KiCad and attach them to post. However some components may not have SPICE models (especially because most of them are probably no longer produced). In such cases I will use replacement components which have available SPICE models. Another problem is that values of some electronic elements on the image with the image are blurred/vague. Therefore I may unintentionally assume bad element values.   


## 1. Inputs and outputs description
Description of inputs and outputs is available at [1] in "SCHEMATICS" tab. It is written in German. Below I provide a translated and simplified version of inputs and outputs documentation. I skipped information that is not necessary to understand the operation of the amplifier and its circuit.
